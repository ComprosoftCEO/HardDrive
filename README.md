Game Engine

<br />

## Compiling and Running

Make sure you have `javac` version 8 or later installed on your computer.
Then, you can build the program using:

```
make
```

This will create an executable jar file named `Main.jar`.
In Windows, you can double-click on the file to run it. Otherwise, use

```
java -jar Main.jar
```

or

```
make run
```

You will need to have a display attached or the program will not be able to run.

If you need to rebuild the program from scratch, you can do:

```
make clean
make
```
